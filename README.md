# AGRI-TECH
 for the agritech project
Please answer these questions to formalize your documentation. You will be adding it to your github. 
 
1. What is the purpose of your project? 
 
     The purpose of the software project for our food transportation business is to develop a comprehensive and efficient system that facilitates the transportation of agricultural products from farmers to marketplaces.  This software project will optimize the logistical processes involved in the food supply chain, ultimately improving farmers' livelihoods, increasing their access to markets, reducing food wastage, and ensuring the delivery of quality products to consumers. 
 
 
2. What problem does your project solve or address? 
 
 
Transportation Gap: There is often a significant gap between farmers and marketplaces in terms of transportation resources. Farmers may face challenges in finding reliable and cost-effective transportation options to transport their produce to marketplaces, leading to delays, increased costs, and limited market access.  
Inefficiency and Productivity: Manual and fragmented logistical processes can lead to inefficiencies and reduced productivity in the food supply chain. Lack of streamlined systems for order management, documentation, and communication can result in delays, errors, and increased administrative burden for farmers and other stakeholders. 
Food Wastage: Inadequate transportation systems can contribute to higher rates of food wastage. Delays, improper handling, and lack of real-time visibility can lead to spoilage, damage, and deterioration of agricultural products during transportation, resulting in significant food losses. 
Limited Information Monitoring: Without proper systems in place, farmers and other stakeholders may lack visibility and real-time information about the transportation status of their goods. This lack of information monitoring can hinder decision-making, coordination, and efficient resource allocation. 
Quality Control: Ensuring the delivery of high-quality products to marketplaces is crucial for farmers to maintain their reputation and secure fair prices. The absence of mechanisms to monitor and select the best products for transportation can result in the transport of subpar goods, impacting the farmers' market competitiveness.  
 
3. What are the key features and functionalities of your project? 
 
As an online platform, we provide a user-friendly online platform accessible to farmers, transportation providers, and marketplaces. Also a simple secure user authentication and role-based access control. 
 
Then for the order Management, through our platform, farmers can easily create transportation requests, specifying their location, and quantity of produce that they want to sell (this will be done by respecting the limits provided by the company in order to ensure the quality of transportation). Transportation providers (the car owners) can view and accept relevant transportation requests based on their availability and capacity (this capacity issue will be solved by deciding on a range of kilograms that has to be transported) 
 
To ensure an easy payment process, we are planning on the Integration of an accounting system for seamless financial transactions. 
 
For the messaging and the overall communication with the stakeholders, a messaging functionality (to facilitate communication between farmers, transportation providers, and marketplaces) will be installed. Also, another feature to be added is the feature of automated notifications and alerts regarding pickup/delivery schedules, delays, and other important updates. 
 
Insights and actionable data for stakeholders to make informed decisions and improve operations. (this feature is to help the wholesalers to decide what product from which location exactly they want to buy, based on the most affordable product available). 
 
For Scalability, we want to ensure scalability to accommodate a growing user base, increased transportation volumes, and additional features in the future. 
 
For security and privacy, strong security measures to protect user data, transactions, and communications will be introduced. 
 
One of the key features that we want to integrate for our project is mobile Accessibility. A mobile application or responsive design to facilitate access and usage on smartphones and tablets for on-the-go convenience. (This will be developed once the system has been used successfully and the need of a mobile app has been raised). 
 
4. What technologies or programming languages are used in your project? 
 
Backend Development: PHP (possibly Python too) 
Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
 
For our database Management, we will use a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), such as MySQL (we will be using XAMPP because it contains MySQL). 
 
5. What are the system requirements or dependencies for running your project? 
 
6. How can someone install or set up your project? 
The software that will be used to access our system is a website. So it can be easily installed and accessed through a computer. But anyone with a smartphone can easily install our app which will have the same features as our website. This is to enable anyone with a smartphone to get access to our services. For the website, To access it, there is only the need of connection, a computer or a phone and it can be easily installed as an application through Play Store or app store, depending on the device used. 
The setup is easy, first is the registration on the websitesâ€™ sign up page, by providing your name,a valid phone number, and your role in the system.

7. What are the steps to run or deploy your project? 

To run our project, we are going first, looking for testers (who are ready to try our system). And from there we will be updating according to their feedback about the app and the services that we provide.

8. Are there any configuration files or environment variables that need to be set up?

Download XAMPP (for database management),  a code editing software (preferably VScode), and a version control app (GitHub).
 
9. Are there any external APIs or services that your project relies on? If so, how can they be integrated? 

There are not yet any external APIs or services that your project relies on, but we are working on how to integrate those features to enhance the system flexibility.

10. Are there any known issues, limitations, or bugs in your project? 

For now, there is not any issue encountered yet. That is because the project is still new and lack enough users in order to notice any problem related to how the system works. 

11. How can someone contribute to your project? Do you have guidelines for code contributions? 

The contribution is done via GitHub. The condition is to be part of the contributors team in order to be able to make changes to the project. Every contributor has to clone the project, improve it, write documentation on what was worked on, then send his code to the secondary branch in order to be verified and confirmed in order to be sent to the main branch.

12. Are there any tests included in your project? How can someone run them? 

We are not yet at this level, we are still at the development level. We will work on this step as we evolve. 

13. Do you have documentation or examples to help users understand how to use your project? 

We do have documentation about our project, but we are also working on a more concise and clear documentation that will fully explain the functionalities and features that are available in our system and how each of them can be used in the most efficient way.

14. Are there any licenses or usage restrictions associated with your project? 

To the development side, There is not yet any license that has to be followed from now, but as the project evolving, we are going to need a project license in order to keep specifying who has the rights to be part of our community.

15. How can someone contact you or your team for support or inquiries? 

For any inquiry or need of support, to speak with a member of our team directly, you can contact our customer support hotline at +256757016757.

We also provide in-person assistance for any major issue. 

16. Do you have a roadmap or future plans for your project? 

Our road map so far is the following:

Development and Testing: this is the current step we are at. 
Initial Deployment and User Onboarding: this is the step where we are going to get our first clients (testers), in order to get their feedback and see how they find the system (then update accordingly). 
Expansion and Market Penetration: Gradually scale up the deployment of the software to a broader user base, targeting farmers, transportation providers, and marketplaces.
